# Bash Scripts Collection

This repository contains a collection of bash scripts created to automate various repetitive tasks, driven by my laziness to perform them manually. 

## List of Scripts

1. **Home Network Connector (`connect-home-network`)**  
   A script to automatically connect to your home network. You can customize it to connect to any network of your choice.

2. **Network Disconnector (`disconnect-network`)**  
   A script to disconnect from the currently connected network. You can customize it for any network.

3. **CRETEM Utility (`cretem-utility`)**  
   A utility script for creating templates for Java, C++, and C programs. This is highly useful for competitive coding.

4. **Git Utils**  
   Github utilities for people who don't know how to use git.
  

5. **Swap**  
   A command line utility to swap the name of two files.I found this useful during the configuration of my i3wm and neovim.This is specifically useful when you have to switch the names of two files back and forth repeatedly.
