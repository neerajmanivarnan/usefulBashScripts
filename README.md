# Bash Scripts Collection

This repository contains a collection of bash scripts created to automate various repetitive tasks, driven by my laziness to perform them manually. All these scripts are now connected via a single script, `bash-utility.sh`, which provides an easy-to-use menu for selecting and running the scripts.

## List of Scripts

1. **Home Network Connector (`connect-home-network`)**  
   A script to automatically connect to your home network. You can customize it to connect to any network of your choice.

2. **Network Disconnector (`disconnect-network`)**  
   A script to disconnect from the currently connected network. You can customize it for any network.

3. **CRETEM Utility (`cretem-utility`)**  
   A utility script for creating templates for Java, C++, and C programs. This is highly useful for competitive coding.

4. **Git Utils (`git-main` and `git-branch`)**  
   A set of scripts that automate repetitive Git tasks like adding, committing, and pushing changes:
   - **`git-main`** is used to add changes and push them directly from the main branch.
   - **`git-branch`** is used to add changes from another branch and push them to the main branch.

## How to Use

To save time, add these scripts to your PATH so they can be accessed easily from anywhere in your terminal.

### Steps:
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/usefulBashScripts.git
   export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/usefulBashScripts
